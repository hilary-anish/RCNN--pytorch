# RCNN--pytorch (using VGG-16 pretrained model)

### The dataset includes -- Various aerial images of Airplanes
### Object Detection is performed using the RCNN object detector

## Motive of the Project - 
### While I was trying to understand RCNN, most of the python code were in Tensorflow-Keras Framework
### so, I have tried to implement the RCNN object detector in pytorch framework


## Further Developments:
### Though the results are good, they are not consistent, this could be improvised by an additional SVM layer at the end 
along with a linear regression for the bounding boxes
